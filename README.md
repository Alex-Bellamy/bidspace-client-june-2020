# Craft Academy Final Project - BidSpace
[Deployed at Netlify](https://bidspace.netlify.app/) <br />
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1cc7a97d-fe63-4123-8e62-c95e5d285cfd/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bidspace/deploys)

## The challenge
Using newly acquired skills to work independently, plan and execute a complex web app with my fellow students. 

After brainstorming we decided to go with an app where landlords can list their parking space and people can bid on it - 'Airbnb' of the parking space world. Built in React with a corresponding API (also in my repos).

We were pushed out of your comfort zone to work with more complicated tools, building on the many and varied skills we had developed over the previous weeks. We worked in a team to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that would be ready to ship to a real customer.
